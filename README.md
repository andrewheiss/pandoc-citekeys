# pandoc-citekeys

* `bib_keys.py`: Finds all the cite keys from a BibTeX file and puts them in a text file that can be read by TextExpander.
* `bib_extract.py`: Finds all the cite keys used in a Markdown file and extracts them from a large, master BibTeX file into a new .bib file containing only those bibliographic entries (good for distributing clean paper-specific bibliographies)

Usage instructions are included in each script.
